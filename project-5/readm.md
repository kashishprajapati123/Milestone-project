As a web developer, designing animation websites involves a combination of technical skills, creativity, and an understanding of user experience. Here are some steps and considerations for designing animation websites from a web developer's perspective:

1. **Planning and Research**: Start by understanding the client's requirements and the target audience for the website. Conduct research on the industry and competitors to identify trends and design ideas related to animations.

2. **Storyboarding and Prototyping**: Create a storyboard or wireframes to visualize the flow of the website and where animations can be incorporated. Use prototyping tools to create interactive mockups that showcase how the animations will work in the final design.

3. **Choose the Right Tools**: There are various tools and technologies available for designing animations. CSS, JavaScript, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are commonly used for web-based animations. Additionally, you can use animation libraries like GSAP, anime.js, or ScrollMagic to simplify the animation process.

4. **Keep it Simple and Purposeful**: Animations should have a clear purpose and be strategically placed to enhance user engagement. Avoid overwhelming the website with too many animations that might distract users from the main content.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Pay close attention to performance optimization. Optimize animations for smooth rendering and fast loading times. Use CSS hardware acceleration and minimize unnecessary DOM manipulations to avoid janky animations.

6. **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the animations work well across various devices and screen sizes. Test the website on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

7. **Transitions and Interactivity**: Implement smooth transitions between different states of the website elements. Add interactivity to animations, such as hover effects or scroll-triggered animations, to make the website more engaging.

8. **User Feedback and Testing**: Gather feedback from users or colleagues during the development process. Conduct usability testing to identify any issues with the animations and make necessary adjustments based on the feedback.

9. **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. Provide alternative content or interactions for users who may not be able to experience the animations, such as screen reader users.

10. **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to manage your codebase effectively. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and roll back to previous versions if needed.

11. **Document Your Code**: Comment and document your code, especially for complex animations. Clear documentation makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

12. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in web animation. Attend web development conferences, read blogs, and participate in online communities to learn from other web developers.

Designing animation websites as a web developer requires a balance between creativity and technical expertise. By following these steps and considering the user experience, you can create visually appealing and engaging animation websites that leave a positive impact on users.
